# Project Overview
The consumer complaints project focuses on handling and analyzing consumer complaints data in the financial sector. It provides a platform to track, manage, and analyze various financial products and service complaints. By leveraging the power of data analytics, this project aims to provide valuable insights and facilitate better customer service and regulatory compliance.


#  Data Model
The project utilizes a relational data model to structure consumer complaints data. The main table, CONSUMER_COMPLAINTS, contains the relevant columns to capture details such as the date received, product name, sub-product, issue, company, state, and other related information. Refer to the Data Model documentation for a detailed table structure and relationship description.


# Data Loading
I have loaded the consumer complaints data into Snowflake, then create a table in Snowflake that matches the structure of the data. After creating the table perform data cleaning and transformation to ensure that the data aligns with the desired data types and formats. Once the data is cleaned and transformed,  proceed to load it into the table in Snowflake.

create or replace TABLE SQL.PUBLIC.CONSUMER_COMPLAINTS (
	DATE_RECEIVED VARCHAR(16777216),
	"PRODUCT NAME" VARCHAR(100),
	SUB_PRODUCT VARCHAR(100),
	ISSUE VARCHAR(100),
	SUB_ISSUE VARCHAR(100),
	"CONSUMER COMPLAINT NARRATIVE" VARCHAR(5000),
	"Company Public Response" VARCHAR(16777216),
	"Company" VARCHAR(300),
	"State Name" VARCHAR(400),
	"Zip Code" NUMBER(38,0),
	"Tags" VARCHAR(100),
	"Consumer Consent Provided" VARCHAR(200),
	"Submitted via" VARCHAR(16777216),
	"Date Sent to Company" VARCHAR(16777216),
	"Company Response to Consumer" VARCHAR(200),
	"Timely Response" VARCHAR(400),
	"CONSUMER DISPUTED" VARCHAR(400),
	COMPLAINT_ID NUMBER(12,0) NOT NULL,
	primary key (COMPLAINT_ID)
);
